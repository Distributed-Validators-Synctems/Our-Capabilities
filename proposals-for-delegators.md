# What-we-can

> We do a lot. We can much more!
> Delegate to our fellow Validators, choose one that suites best for you: https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/Self-Identity/
> Or offer us to run a validator in a network where we are not presented, so you could delegate and don't think about running own instance. No worries, slashing, losses - only gains from our stable services. And that's not all - we will compensate you the slashing, if happens on our side!
